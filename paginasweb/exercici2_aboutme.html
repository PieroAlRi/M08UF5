        <b>Betty Botter</b> had some butter, <i>&lt;&quot;Bu&quot;&gt;</i>, she said, <i>&lt;&quot;this butters bitter. If I bake this bitter butter, it would make my batter bitter. But a bit of better butter – that would make my batter better.&quot;&gt;</i> So she bought a bit of butter, better than her bitter butter, and she baked it in her batter, and the batter was not bitter. So &apos;twas better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter.
